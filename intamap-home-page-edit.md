Data! Data! Data! How Intamap learnt from Sherlock Holmes and solved the problem of finding your front door
================================================================

221B Baker Street (see photo above) is one of the most famous addresses in the world: Sir Arthur Conan Doyle used it as the home for Sherlock Holmes, his fictional detective who popularised a logical, data-driven approach to problem solving.

Most people, today, who want to find their way to 221B Baker Street won't use any intellectual power or detective work; they will pop its postcode (NW1 6XE) into their satnav or smartphone and expect to be guided to the door.

And with 221B they will be lucky; by a fortunate quirk of fate, postcode NW1 6XE is centred on 221B Baker Street. Unfortunately, it also covers the section of Baker Street between Park Road and Melcombe Street, so anyone using this postcode to find any other address will have some sleuthing to do; navigation by postcode is a modern conundrum, a waste of time and effort for which modern mapping should provide a solution.

You don't need to be Sherlock Holmes to realise that the uilty culprit in this mystery is misuse of the humble postcode. This was introduced over forty years ago to assist the Royal Mail (or GPO as it was called then) to sort letters ready for delivery. A single postcode may contain up to 100 addresses and cover a mile or more in remote areas.

Today, many businesses use the postcode to identify their location on their web site maps; hardly a precise solution and not the best use of modern technology. The online map is achieving a technological marvel called geo-coding, but is using low-quality data.

And as Sherlock Holmes once declared 'Data! Data! Data! I can’t make bricks without clay.'

<blockquote>Sir Arthur Conan Doyle understood the importance of logic when it comes to solving a mystery. In The Adventure of the Copper Beeches, his character, Sherlock Holmes, becomes frustrated at a lack of detail that makes his decision-making process impossible. In effect, Holmes requires concrete facts to solve the mystery presented by Miss Hunter’s job offer from Mr Rucastle. Holmes’ exclamation is one of the best-known lines that Conan Doyle ever wrote, and that may be because of its wide-ranging appeal. In the modern world, the need for accuracy is as relevant as it was in the author’s era. Businesses must locate good quality information to make effective decisions, and for precisely the same reasons as Sherlock Holmes.</blockquote>

Data! Data! Data!: Intamap's logical solution to broadcasting location data
==============================================================================

As part of our web development and web mapping work, we view many thousands of web sites a year. A by-product of this is that we collect, correct, and curate thousands of commercial building locations throughout the UK, which we store in our databases. This is valuable data that should not be hidden away on our servers when it might be of use. We have, therefore, decided to publish some of this location data on industry-specific maps. We call these maps "locatories" as they are primarily a demonstration of the accuracy and quantity of the location data we have collected. An industry Locatory will have a significant percentage of the total businesses in an a particular industry.

You can view a typical Locatory layout here: Heritage Railways Industry  [NOTE: DO WE MAKE ICON SMALLER? IN LONG RUN, WE SHOULD MAKE IT RESPONSIVE!]
