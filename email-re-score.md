Every year, the Gettinghe.re team view thousands of business web sites.

When we visit a site, we search to see if there is sufficient information to enable someone visiting the business premises for the first time to get there as easily as possible.

Today more than ever, time is money and people now expect to use web site information and GPS technology to get them exactly where they want with minimum effort and in the shortest possible time. Unfortunately, many business web sites do not provide adequate information to make this possible.

Gettinghe.re has created a useful guide to illustrate the six levels of information which are currently displayed on business web sites. You can view the guide at http://www.gettinghe.re/ghr_location_guide.html.

We currently grade your location/contact page as a (?). Currently most business web sites are between C and F; our research indicates that most business visitors would prefer them to be an A or B!

Gettinghe.re can put your business on the map - accurately and with useful supporting travel information, thereby saving time and stress for first-time visitors.

Our Gettinghe.re "to-your-door" service provides accurate* business location, routing, travel, and contact information in a consistent form. This is combined with links to key pages on your web  site and your social media.

Our service is easy to print and easy to view on your tablet or phone.

Put all this together, and Gettinghe.re is an ideal resource for the (?????) industry and people on the move.

A visit to the [Gettinghe.re web site](make this a live link) will provide you with more information on how your business can provide a better location service for your customers, suppliers, or indeed anyone who needs to visit your premises.

* Unusually for mapping services, we use precise latitude and longitude coordinates not postcodes to determine a location.
